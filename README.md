# Chess in Python in PyQt6
An app allowing you to play a game of chess. Application is writte in Python.

For now it allows you only to customize the size of tiles of a chessboard. There are almost all rules of chess applied in the game with exception of pawn promotion (in development). 

In order to run application you need to run main.py (.exe file will be added in the future).

In repo there are some files that are not currently used (like "chess_ai" or "chess_server") but will be in the future. If they are bothering you feel free to get rid of them.

The game will be getting more developped with time.
 
If u find any bugs/errors feel free to inform me.

# Chess in Python in PyQt6
A game allowing to play chess written in Python. 

For now it allows you to customize the size of tiles of a chessboard. There are almost all rules of chess applied in the game with exception of pawn promotion (in development). 

In order to run application you need to run main.py (.exe file will be added in the future)

In repo there are some files that are not currently used but will be in the future. The game will be getting more developped with time.

If they are bodering you feel free to get rid of them. If u find any bugs/errors feel free to message me.
